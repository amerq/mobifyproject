# Mobify Stub Connector
This connector is intended to be a starting place for building a new custom connector. It contains stubs for all of the `commands` the Integration Manager expects. For some `commands`, it also dispatches the associated `results` with example data.

To use this connector, replace the stubs with functions that work with your back end system.
